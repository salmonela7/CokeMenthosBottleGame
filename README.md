# CokeMenthosBottleGame
A small mobile game I am making in my spare time. STATUS: IN PROGRESS

In this game you are playing as a Coke bottle. 
Every once in a while you chuck a menthos inside the bottle. 
The bottle lanches into a certain trajectory.
The time slows down right before the launch happens, so you have time to aim.

Animations not in game yet.
The game is in extremely early phase, some key features are missing.

Enjoy
